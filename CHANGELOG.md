## 1.0.0 (2018-10-04)

Although this version is backwards compatible, I decided to bump from 0.1.1 to 1.0.0 to make clear the implementation is complete.

### Added

- Blocking API for reading events:

```rust
let event_source = EventSource::new("http://event-stream-address/sub").unwrap();

for event in event_source.receiver().iter() {
    println!("New Message: {}", event.data);
}
```

## 0.1.1 (2018-10-04)

### Fixed:

- hosts didn't work when port not provided
